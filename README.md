# JHTTP

This project is a simple HTTP server (nowhere near feature complete).
That experiments with features in the Rust language. As we develop this library
over time, we'll introduce more and more complex features and so the git
history will describe an evolution of technique (hopefully).

# Features

When we develop features we'll add them here so that we have a list of running
and developed features. This will help guide our trajectory into the future!

# Supported Features

    1. Running a TCP server
    2. Parse HTTP Request and text body


# Features in Development

    1. Responding to an HTTP Request
    2. Serving files with GET methods
    3. Receiving POST data
